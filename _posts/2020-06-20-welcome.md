# Welcome

## Why lingo coliseum?
A blog is a public place for writing things down.
All communication reduces to some sort of language game, and on a blog these games are open to the public.

## Then why not "language coliseum"?
I want to deflate any romance about what this blog represents, and I'm hoping "lingo" is a vulgar enough word to do the trick.
This blog is not here to communicate epic knowledge or wisdom.
This becomes obvious whenever I revisit them. Sometimes painfully obvious.
This name is simply a reminder to revisit my writings, softly and often. To lessen the blow while I bring myself full circle.

## So why are you here?
By far, the most meaningful periods of my life were those in which I regularly tried to recapitulate my thoughts to a word processor.
The cringe of past self-indulgence?
Or the bittersweet nostalgia of having a mind-tempest blow itself out?
The sadness is form, the happiness content.[1]

I have tried (stubbornly) and failed (considerably) to reproduce this experience in other media.
So (begrudgingly), here I am.

## Who is your audience?
Future versions of me. All other audiences are accidental, or brief manifestations of delusional grandeur.

## An administrative note
This site is emphatically barebones, and according to the above, it must stay that way. While serious bloggers should aspire to the magnificent achievement that is [Gwern's](https://www.gwern.net/), this one will not.
