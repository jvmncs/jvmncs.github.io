# About

Hi, I'm Jason. I spend my time working on machine learning research and engineering.
My interests are all over the place, but most of my recent professional work has been related to the privacy and security of machine learning systems.
<!-- Currently, I work at [Cape Privacy](https://capeprivacy.com), and I'm one of the maintainers of [TF Encrypted](https://github.com/tf-encrypted/tf-encrypted).
I also have a long history within the [OpenMined](https://openmined.com) community, which is where my interest in private machine learning began around 2017. -->
Anything I write here is meant to be finished in under a day, and usually not more than a few hours. If an idea hasn't had its way with me by then, that's generally a bad sign for the work's authenticity & necessity. As such, this site is more of a journal than a blog.

"Lingo colosseum" is a rough metonymy for "place of public language games".
This is a vulgar reference to the [philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Investigations).
I'm not overtly into Wittgenstein's philosophy, but I like this name for a few reasons:
- Any writing I do here will have some strongly dependent context. I will aim to write as clearly as I possibly can within that context.
- By reading, you are committing to active participation in a highly structured game that I intended mainly for myself. By playing along, you are likely wasting your time; to do so in bad faith would be an unimaginably slow and boring act of suicide.
- Wittgenstein experienced a departure from the strong rationalism of his youth during his middle years, which is the kind of radical self-awareness I aspire to -- especially when I write things here.
